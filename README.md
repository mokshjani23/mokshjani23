### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is Moksh Jani. I am a Senior at Iowa State studying the exciting and innovative field known as Aerospace Engineering. I really enjoy Aerospace and conquering the challenges it has to offer. I am really interested in honing the important skills that GitHub has to offer by utilizing the online and classroom resources at my disposal. I believe this will be a very important skill, especially when it comes to doing work for a company, as many companies use GitHub as a hub to relay information to others. As well as taking this programming course, I am also working on learning the visualization and understanding of aerodynamics and propulsion, the study of flight stuructures, and learning how various components have an impact on aerospace systems. Outside of academic practices, I very much enjoy doing a plethora of things. I love the outdoors and any chance that I get, I will go on hikes and explore different areas. I also love to play video games, specifically single player, story-mode games. Overall, I am really excited to learn more about the benfit and advancements of aerospace technology and its impact on daily life.
